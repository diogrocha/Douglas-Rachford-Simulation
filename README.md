# Douglas-Rachford-Simulation
Numerical code that implements the Douglas-Rachford algorithm to solve the heat 
equation in three dimensions with finite differences

This is a Python Code, you can run it in a Spyder Distribution. 
There are three versions of this numerical simulation with different boundary conditions (Cauchy, Neumann and Dirichlet).
